Waddles is a bot that makes you able to create invites in order to
invite your friends to a discord server. When it is ran, will it listen
to 3 channels: 汳娯買create-invite, 沐｣笏ニoin-with-code and 笨笏ツheck-invites

All the channels are pretty self-explanatory.

The 汳娯買create-invite will create a randomly generated invite code for
each memberr of the discord server that starts with "SC-". 
You can activate with using the command "/create".
When the bot recognizes this command it will generate the invite code
that you can send to your friend.

In the 沐｣笏ニoin-with-code channel is made for your friend to type in the
unique invite code that you send to him. When he has done that, the bot
will update your score for the qualified users that you have currently
invited.

The 笨笏ツheck-invites channel only has 1 purpose, to show you your score
of the qualified users that you have currently invited.
You can activate it using the command "/invites".
If you've invited 10 people, you will automatically receive the 
"BE MEMBERS" role.
