WADDLES(Discord Bot)  made for lala13

Waddles is a bot that makes you able to create invites in order to
invite your friends to a discord server. When it is ran, will it listen
to 3 channels: 💌┃create-invite, 🔣┃join-with-code and ✅┃check-invites

All the channels are pretty self-explanatory.

The 💌┃create-invite will create a randomly generated invite code for
each memberr of the discord server that starts with "SC-". 
You can activate with using the command "/create".
When the bot recognizes this command it will generate the invite code
that you can send to your friend.

In the 🔣┃join-with-code channel is made for your friend to type in the
unique invite code that you send to him. When he has done that, the bot
will update your score for the qualified users that you have currently
invited.

The ✅┃check-invites channel only has 1 purpose, to show you your score
of the qualified users that you have currently invited.
You can activate it using the command "/invites".
If you've invited 10 people, you will automatically receive the 
"BE MEMBERS" role.


All the distribution rights are in the hands of the wonderfull person,
